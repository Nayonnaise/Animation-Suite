# Animation-Suite
A series of randomally generated animations

Run the 'master' script to see the animation in a pygame window. 
The projects are made up of a couple of 'pathing' script files denoted by the "P_" file prefix and animation files "A_".
The types of pathing and animation functions used can be changed by altering lines 9 & 10 in the Master script
